REGULATIONS: Introduction</h4>

All civil aviation activities in the undivided India was regulated by the Aircraft Rules, 1920. Subsequently, the Aircraft Rules, 1920 was superseded on 23rd March, 1937 by the Aircraft Rules, 1937. On 19th July, 1960 the then President of Pakistan issued the Civil Aviation Ordinance, 1960 abrogating the Aircraft Act, 1934. This Ordinance along with the Aircraft Rules, 1937 had been the legal regulatory framework for all civil aviation activities in Bangladesh until 23rd August, 1984 when the Civil Aviation Rules, 1984 was promulgated by the Government of the Peopleï¿½s Republic of Bangladesh. Therefore, the present legal regulatory frame work for civil aviation activities in Bangladesh is the Civil Aviation Rules, 1984, and the Air Navigation Orders issued by the Chairman under this rule.</td>
